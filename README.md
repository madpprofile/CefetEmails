# CefetEmails

The object of this project is to create an algorithm to auto-generate e-mails for all students/professors of CEFET/RJ. Although, it can be used to generate any e-mails, you just have to give it the domain.

Note: This is **NOT** a perfect algorithm, which means it won't always generate e-mails for every collision.

Usage: **progname input.csv output.csv @domain.example**
